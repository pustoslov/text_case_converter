# Text case converter
This is just a simple program for converting text case. I created it because I found nothing similar.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have JDK 21 (or higher) installed.
2. Download `text_case_converter-<current version>.jar` from Releases.
3. To run program type in terminal:
    ```bash
   java -jar <path to downloaded file>
    ```
   **(additional)** If you are a macOS user and you don't want to type anything in the terminal every time to launch a program, do this in terminal:
    ```bash
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <path to downloaded file>
    ```
   Now you can run it with a simple double-click.
